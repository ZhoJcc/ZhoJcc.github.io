                <h3>Final Version</h3>
                <div class="essay-document-text">
                    <p>For the longest time, my mother refused to make the switch from her old flip phone to a new smartphone. She's always been an "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" kind of person, and her computer worked fine for what she needed. I'd already been using smartphones and other gadgets for a couple of years at this point, so I knew she'd like being able to check her Yahoo and other things without waiting to reach a computer. A combination of months of me bugging her and her carrier offering a good deal on a new device finally broke her down.</p>
                    <p>She started off using her new iPhone pretty similarly to how she'd use her old phone. She'd answer calls when they came in (assuming she knew who was calling), send a couple of texts here and there, but otherwise, the phone sat around. Eventually, I started showing her she could check her emails, search things on Yahoo, and just about anything else I'd catch her doing on her computer. She'd become frustrated from time to time, but picked things up quickly. Thankfully, my mother is an extremely bright person.</p>
                    <p>After a few weeks of being shown different apps and features, she began to realize the advantages of her switch. She started to make comments about how much faster it was to do certain things and slowly started using her computer less, and the phone more. I look back on this period of time with nostalgia. It felt good to teach the woman who'd literally taught me everything.</p>
                    <p>Now, Mom hates her computer because it's too big. She'll pull it out if she has to for some online form that isn't compatible with mobile devices (often complaining about how people need to "get with the times"), but not often by choice. She also now uses Google and Gmail instead of Yahoo. (That one took me years to convince her!) It always drove me nuts when she'd go to "Google" something and open Yahoo search. All in all, as frustrating as it was at times, it turned out to be a great experience.</p>

                <h3>Reflection on Essay 1</h3>
                <div class="reflection-text-area">
                    <p>My process for this essay was straightforward, focusing on a familiar story. I outlined my mom’s transition from flip phone to smartphone: her initial reluctance, my step-by-step guidance, and her eventual acceptance. Telling it chronologically felt most natural.</p>
                    <p>This essay taught me to convey personal experiences engagingly. It’s not just about recalling an event, but making it resonate. I focused on *showing* my mom's change—her shift from frustration to appreciating speed, or from Yahoo to Google—rather than just stating it. It showed how everyday moments can form a solid narrative if you highlight the human element.</p>
                    <p>A key challenge was conciseness—selecting moments that best illustrated her transformation and my role, without losing the story's core. During revision, I focused on pacing and ensuring the conclusion felt resolved. I also aimed to inject a bit of my own voice and the situation's inherent humor, like the Yahoo debate.</p>
                    <p>Overall, this piece effectively captured a relatable family experience. For that point in the semester, it demonstrated clear narrative structure and the ability to convey personal observations, establishing a good foundation in descriptive writing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Note on Writing Process:</strong> No separate rough draft file is included for this essay. The writing process involved outlining key chronological events and focusing on descriptive details to bring the narrative to life. Revisions centered on pacing, word choice to convey tone, and ensuring a satisfying conclusion to the personal story.</p>
